Hello friends~

GFCS interrupts your CTF hacking fun with a short story and a little side note! 

The story is in the picture (highlight text) and the password (highlight text) is -

On a side note, we thought we'd highlight, a little spell cast on the PDF has blinded him for now... :( Until you set him free, to see what he has to offer, you need to look inside of him, at how he is built. After you have removed the spell and when you believe the PDF is ready to tell you his story, use his master (aka Adobe) to read his contents. For now, his distressed master doesn't know why he's not saying anything...

On a side side and unrelated note, idk about you, but CTF is driving me nuts. Watch this cute video (insert video of Golden Retriever mimics the sound of police siren) to destress. 

Many uwus and much whines, 
GFCS
