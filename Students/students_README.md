# 50.042 CTF Challenge

## Challenge description:
Bobby left a secret message for Alice within a pdf file and zipped it tight with 12 characters. Bobby's both a paelographer and HIGHLY skilled cryptographer, although he has a very bad habit of using weak prime numbers and hides his messages in streams? Retrieve the logical message as the flag in the format ```ctf{text}```.

*Hint: When editing files, make sure to check the file size when you save.*
