On a random day, at a random time, Bobby sits with his child, Charlie in the park.

Bobby: “Charlie boy, do you know why I’m a paelographer?”
Charlie: “I don’t know daddy, is it cause you like to get to the root of the way things work?”
Bobby: “Well, partially. We aspire to discover roots and be like a tree, planted by the water stream, so that we can be big and strong.”
Charlie: “Why aren’t all trees by the stream big and strong?”
Bobby: “That’s because they’re blocked by big boulders so the water can’t flow through them to let them show their full potential!”
Charlie: “Oh...so they end up...kinda empty?”
Bobby: “Yes Charlie, yes. We gotta move those boulders.”
% Bobby: “Man. Kids are tiring...”

Unable to hear Bobby’s comment, even though he was right next to him just like the empty trees that cannot gain full access to the stream, Charlie springs off, heading straight for the boulders...
